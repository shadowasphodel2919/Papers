The basic aim of the paper as described by the author Zdenek Kopal was to give a history of lunar mapping in pre-telescopics era and immediate history after the discovery of telescope.This paper is the most remarkable paper I have come across till now this paper was published on 3 June 1969.This paper was written Kopal after some time the first landing on moon comemorating the contribution of early prominent figures without which we would not have been where we are now.
The author first takes us back all the way a few years before the first telescope was invented by Galileo to the time of Queen Elizabeth I to the finding of William Gilbert which was the first person to create a map of the moon as seen by the naked eye.His most remarkable feat was the many of the features that he made on the map can now be perfectly seen on the moon. But alas his works were not published till the year 1651 by James Boswell.
Gilbert had died more than 6years prior to the invention of the telescope while his biggest regret was that no one has mapped the moon prior to him so he worried the changes moon underwent and we hope that now he knows that the moon had not undergone change since the advent of telescopes.
Then the author moves to time after telescope was invented now after its invention the only celestial body which everyone could clearly watch was the moon so the people started drawing it.Now the first maps submitted by Galileo were rather very uninformative as he didn't pay much attention to the details but at the same time there was a contender of Galileo in Germany named P.Cristoph Scheiner who also made it to the first accont of selenography.But the most prominent work was done by Thomas Harriot who drew detailed maps of the telescopic view of the moon .While his drawing were highly superior to Galileo but his work but they remained unpublished for even a longer time than the work of Gilbert ,his works were first mentioned by von Zach and Rigaud but his works were finally reproduced by Strout in so late as 1965 from the MSS in possession of the Earl of Egremont.

The author dives deep in the depth of the early selenography and gives a very details accounts of the very first selenographers which make us look at the time which we live in whichcould not have been possible otherwise.
